SpeedBar
---------

__What SpeedBar is not:__

1. Speedbar is not a minimap, it does not show you your location in the code.
2. Speedbar is not a filesystem "tree" viewer, although it can be used as one.

__What is SpeedBar:__

1. An informational panel more customizable and powerful than any of the above.
2. A place to show a list of buffers.
3. Can show documentation on functions being used.
4. Can provide an org agenda view.

Since more than likely you will not want speedbar to appear as popup frame, you will need to install
sr-speedbar.
