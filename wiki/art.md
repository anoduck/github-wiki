## Art

For the premises of this entry, art refers to ascii/ansi/text art. Although, neither
ascii, ansi, or text alone correctly describe it correctly. This is because not all
ascii art use ascii characters, sometimes they use ansi, and not all text art use
text as we think of it.

The "logo" or heading image at the top of this page is an example of text art.
