## Art

For the premises of this entry, art refers to ascii/ansi/text/nfo art. Although, neither
ascii, ansi, nfo, nor text art describe it appropriately. Ascii and ansi are text formats, 
where text and nfo are file types. Regardless, "ascii art" predominantly is the most commonly
used term for this form of artistic expression.

The "logo" or heading image at the top of this page is an example of text art, and it was
created by the program figlet.

### Popular programs

There are several well known applications that provide the ability to create art.
