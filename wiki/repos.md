## Places to find and store code

Much akin to the Empire taking over the homebase of the rebel alliance, a few years ago, GitHub sold out to
Microsoft. Ever since, there has been a slow, but steady migration away from it. Unfortunately, this slow
migration has not been toward a uniform alternative, in fact, it has been quite sporadic and decentralized.
Making it more difficult for purveyors of fine code to locate and facilitize such code resources. Below is a
list of several of these alternative sites.

* [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org): Sponsored by a nonprofit, allows private, attempting to be the primary
	alternative.
* [gitgud.io](https://gitgud.io): Sponsored repository by several private developers, allows private repos.
* [sr.ht](https://sr.ht): A very popular repository hosting site, requires payment to actually host code. ðŸ˜¦
* [mzte.de](https://mzte.de): Sponsored repository by private group, similar to gitgud.io
