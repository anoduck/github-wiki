## OpenCV

OpenCV is a python library comprised of several hundred algorithms dealing with computational vision and
artificial intelligence. Computational vision is a fancy way of saying photos, video, and informational
visiualizations, but it is important to remember it encapsulates more than that. Computatational vision is how
an electronic device can see, visualize, manipulate, and comprehend visual data.
