### [Visidata](https://www.visidata.org)

Visidata is a spreadsheet editor for the command line, that combines the efficiency of the command line with the clarity of a
spreadsheet. It can handle a bloody ton of data in a very efficient and productive manner, and possesses features that cannot be found
in other spreadsheet editors. It is flexible, customizable, programmable with the python api, and allows plugins for extra
functionality. Unfortunately, it's keycodes are rather unique, and can be confusing to many users. 

#### Keycodes

Below are some basic keycodes we have had difficulty remembering:

| _Code_   | _Command_           |
| -------- | -----------         |
| `^`      | rename Column       |
| `_`      | Adjust Column Width |
| `za`     | Add new Column      |
| `ga`     | Add Rows            |
| `e`      | edit                |
| `q`      | get out of trouble  |

### [sc-im](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im)

This is a long time favorite spreadsheet editor. It is based of the original `sc` spreadsheet editor, with a more convenient keymap
configuration and more features. Unfortunately, you will need to change the color scheme before it is usable.
