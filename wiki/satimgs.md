Satellite Imagery
=================

Recently for a case I am working on, I have had to work with satellite imagery pver the previous three
decades. I did not expect to discover google is surprisingly slow at updating the imagery available to users,
and several other popular imagery mapping services were quite faster updating there imagery. Now that this
entire paragraph is slowly turning into a rambling heap of tossed word salad, I better stop before I make too
big of a mess of the thing.

Basically, up to date high definition satellite imagery can be hard to find. Often it is at least a year old,
sometimes even much older. It took Google four years to finally update the imagery of a location I was
investigating. This slowness to update imagery can cripple an investigation, because important details are
left out, and exposed features can be recovered. Yada, yada, yada...
