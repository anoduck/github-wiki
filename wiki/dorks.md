Search Engine Dorking
=====================

Dorking: is the method of using advanced search engine specific syntax to discover information that may be
hidden or not intended to be publically available for informational security purposes or research.

About Dorking
-------------

Nearly all search engines can be used for dorking, because they all have a syntax structure that allows users
to perform more refined searches. Often these are referred to as "search settings" or "advanced search".

are sites and programs that can do this for you.
