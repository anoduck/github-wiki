## Desktops and Window Managers for all ages and skillsets

Unix offers more variety and choice when it comes to Desktop environments than any other Operational platform.
This is due to Unix's age, and it's popular open source form of distribution. For new users, finally having
variety of choice in their life can lead to an existential crisis. Suddenly, they no longer know who they are,
and what it means to be "themselves". Eventually, they will migrate to being a nomad of desktop environments,
changing their environment once or twice a week for years. This form of migratory existence is quite
detrimental to the maturation of budding script kiddies. So it is for this reason we shall put forth a light
and incomprehensive list of Desktop Environments.

Before we begin our journey we must clarify something. For the purposes of this wiki entry we shall refer to
both desktop environments and window managers as desktop environments. In reality, there is a difference
between a desktop environment and a window manager, just as there is a difference between a central processing
unit and a computer. Window managers refer to software the manages rendering of windows/screens, where desktop
environments refer to homogenous working environment that window managers make up a part of. 

### Our Fucking Fantastic table of Desktop Environments

(Which will more than likely never fully reach anything close to resembling comprehensivity.)

For our fucking fantastic table of Desktop Environments we will:
* Define whether it is a Desktop Environment or a Window Manager.
* Whether it includes Sausages.
* Difficulty of setup.
* Skills needed for Setup.
* User Friendliness.
* Weight, referring to size and load.
* Graphics, referring to visual appeal
* Whether we reccommend or not.
