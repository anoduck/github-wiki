Hackers vs Crackers
===================

__ATTENTION:__ *Please be advised. The term "hacker" or "haxor" is ambiguious in meaning, and refers to many
things. More accurately, all it means to hack something is to use it in a way in which it was not
intended. For example, hacking a spatula could be something as mundane as using a spatula to scrape ice from a
windshield. There are hacking groups throughout the world, they primarily have nothing to do with hacking
things in which hollywood would have you think. In fact, they are rather boring and mostly deal with reverse
engineering some product or software.*

*Phreaks are those who specialize in obtainning access or information from voice communications, primarily
phone systems.*

*Crackers are those who spcialize in cracking passwords and gaining access to accounts or services that employ
cryptography.*
