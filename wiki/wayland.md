## Wayland: I still have not quite figured this thing out... that wayland...

For some reason or another, I always associate Wayland with some slick haired country music singer that smells
of wiskey, cigarettes, and cologne. Not dissing it, just saying...

### WTF is it?

Well, that is a good question. Supposedly it is the long awaited successor to the X windows system. So, it
replaces X, not compliments it. 

### How do I implement it?

Another good question. From what we have read so far the answer is not a fun one. Certain programs that you
would use under X are going to have to be replaced and configured with a Wayland equivolant. This means your
login manager and your vnc server.
