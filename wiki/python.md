## Python Programming Language

Python is a powerful object oriented, integrated, data driven, programming language for all operating systems. Allowing the execution
of object oriented "scripts" that do not require compilation in order to be executed across numerous platforms. It has exploded in
popularity over the years, gained favor in the open source community, and can be run on any platform. Python is one of the most
commonly used programming languages.

### Jupyter Lab

Jupyter lab is a development environment for the python programming language that allows the user to create dynamically responsive
"notebooks" that break code statements into "cells" that can be executed and/or evaluated independently in a succession of steps or as
a standalone execution. Although jupyter lab is somewhat targeted towards teaching, presentation, and data sharing. It has many
benefits that other development environments do not provide that would interest programmers and developers alike.
