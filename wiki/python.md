### Jupyter Lab  

Jupyter lab is a development environment for the python programming language that allows the user to create dynamically responsive
"notebooks" that break code statements into "cells" that can be executed and/or evaluated independently in a succession of steps or as

benefits that other development environments do not provide that would interest programmers and developers alike.
