Hinode
------

Hinode is a template for the Hugo static site generator.

### Hinode Section Layouts

There are three primary section layouts for the hinode template: Lists, Cards, and Navs.

The most basic sectional layout is the list layout, as it provides no additional configuration options except for the basic configuration options
available to all sectional layouts. Do not get this confused with being the default layout, which is the card layout. The card layout also provides
the most amount of configuration options. 

So to recap, "Lists" are the most basic, but "cards" are the default.

Below we list the configuration fields for those sectional layouts.

#### Basic/List

List sections only contain the basic set of configuration options, which the other two available layouts build on top of. Because fundamentally speaking
all sectional layouts are lists. Of course with the rest of Hinode's configuration, the configuration of these layouts is performed in yaml.
