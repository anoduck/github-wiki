## Font Config 

Font config is a set of tools that was intended to provide an interface to allow the user to manage and configure fonts on their system
easily. Although, by modern standards, it doesn't quite meet it's target. 

For most users, the below command is all that is really needed. On some systems it will require execution with root permissions. 

```bash
fc-cache -f 
```
