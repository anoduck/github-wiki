## Org Mode

It was only a matter of time until this wiki ventured into the realm of org. Org Mode is something that is unlike anything else, and is
truly unique to the EMACS text editor. It begin it's existence primarily focused on lists of tasks, but has now expanded to anything
that can be derived from a list. It has taken over a decade of development, and is still being expanded into further forms of
application. 

In a nut shell, Org Mode is basically an outline of items, where items are referred to as nodes. Where each node falls in the outline
effects the prioritization and/or chronology of the node. Nodes also have properties that further describe them and are reflected upon
them, changing how they are handled and treated. Nodes also possess attributes, that are particularly catered towards task managment.
If this sounds complex and confusing, perhaps the best thing is to just look at a normal Org Mode file, and you will see there is not
much to it at all. 

```org
#+TITLE: Example Task File
#+CATEGORY: Examples
# -------------------
* Depending on your preference, any heading on any level can be used as a heading or category indicator.
* Tasks
** TODO Example task 

```
