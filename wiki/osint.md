## Open Source Informational Technology

Really, even before I dove head first into compuer technology, I was already a huge fan of OSINT. It is
something that I have always enjoyed, and at times has proven to be quite beneficial. Below are some links to
various projects and sites concerning Osint. Osint projects have a rather short lifespan, so please keep in
mind, that the contents of this page is probably already outdated upon creation.

__ATTENTION:__ *Please be advised. The term "hacker" or "haxor" is ambiguious in meaning, and refers to many
things. More accurately, all it means to hack something is to use it in a way in which it was not
intended. For example, hacking a spatula could be something as mundane as using a spatula to scrape ice from a
windshield. There are hacking groups throughout the world, they primarily have nothing to do with hacking
things in which hollywood would have you think. In fact, they are rather boring and mostly deal with reverse
engineering some product or software.*

*Phreaks are those who specialize in obtainning access or information from voice communications, primarily
phone systems.*

*Crackers are those who spcialize in cracking passwords and gaining access to accounts or services that employ
cryptography.*

#### Persons Search Engines

Below is a list of search engines that are used for "educational" research to discover information on persons.
There are the ones that proved to be helpful, they are not in any particular order.

* [Nuwber](https://nuwber.com)
* [Family Tree Now](https://www.familytreenow.com)
* [That's Them](https://thatsthem.com)
* [Advanced Background Checks](https://www.advancedbackgroundchecks.com)
* [Fast People Search](https://www.fastpeoplesearch.com)

So far in my experience, I have not found information on a pay-for site that was not also available for free
on another site. So, I reccommend you don't pay for access to those sites.
