## Open Source Informational Technology

Really, even before I dove head first into compuer technology, I was already a huge fan of OSINT. It is
something that I have always enjoyed, and at times has proven to be quite beneficial. Below are some links to
various projects and sites concerning Osint. Osint projects have a rather short lifespan, so please keep in
mind, that the contents of this page is probably already outdated upon creation.

I don't know where else to put this, it isn't quite OSINT, more like just regular IT security. But here:

#### Persons Search Engines

Below is a list of search engines that are used for "educational" research to discover information on persons.
There are the ones that proved to be helpful, they are not in any particular order.

* [Nuwber](https://nuwber.com)
* [Family Tree Now](https://www.familytreenow.com)
* [That's Them](https://thatsthem.com)
* [Advanced Background Checks](https://www.advancedbackgroundchecks.com)
* [Fast People Search](https://www.fastpeoplesearch.com)

So far in my experience, I have not found information on a pay-for site that was not also available for free
on another site. So, I reccommend you don't pay for access to those sites.
