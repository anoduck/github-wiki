## What is emacs?

  An infinite number of monkeys typing into GNU Emacs would never make a good program.
    ~ Linus Torvalds, Linux 1.3.53 CodingStyle documentation

  Emacs is undoubtedly the most powerful programmer's editor in existence. It's a big, feature-laden program with a great deal of flexibility and customizability. â€¦ Emacs has an entire programming language inside it that can be used to write arbitrarily powerful editor functions.
    ~ Eric S. Raymond, The Art of UNIX Programming
