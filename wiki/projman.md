Scrum
-----

Of all the project management techniques, Scrum is most commonly associated with the development of software and
technology. Being such, we shall look at it first.

Scrum project management focuses on the team effort required to achieve a specific task or goal. It uses the
concept of sprints to break tasks down into a time boxed iteration. 

Scrum management is almost synonymously correlated with "Agile management", and employing the use of "agile management
practices". Agile management is so commonly associated with software development, that it actually has been
designated it's own ISO Standard, ISO 21502:2020.
