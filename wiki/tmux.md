## Tmux: The Terminal Multiplexer

As the title says, tmux is a terminal multiplexer of incredible performance. Instead of opening another
instance of your preferred terminal emulator (or open a new tab), tmux allows the user to open another
terminal session inside the current one, inheriting all the current terminals environmental settings and
history. To understand the significance of such a useful application, one needs to examine those moments when
opening up a new terminal instance or tab is not an option, per se when ssh-ing into a remote computer or
using a system that does not provide ann X interface. For these moments tmux is invaluable. For your regular
day-to-day use in a terminal emulator, it is not necessarily the ability to open a new terminal that is
desired, but the ease at which tmux manages these multiple terminal sessions seamlessly and easily.
