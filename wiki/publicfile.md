PublicFile
----------

Publicfile is a stripped and barebone file "server", although it does not serve files in the same sense as
modern webservers do. It's author Daniel J. Bernstein Esq. Phd. describes it as "supplies files to the public
through HTTP and FTP". One might grasp how bareboned and simplistic of a service it provides from this
statement.
