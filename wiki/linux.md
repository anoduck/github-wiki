"I don't always run other systems than OpenBSD, but when I do, I run Linux"
(Primarily, because that is the most probably option)

## Linux

*A Completely Biased and Prejudiced Interpretation:*

Linux is a monolithic modular kernel created by Linus Torvalds, who ripped most of it from Andrew
Tannenbaum's OS MINIX, and published it before MINIX was completed and released. As a result, MINIX was never fully
completed, and Andrew Tannenbaum never recieved the credit due to him.

## Distributions

The brilliance of Torvalds was not his ripping off of MINIX, it was his vision of Linux as an operating
system. Rather than have the Linux kernel tied exclusively to single unified operating system through
licensing, Torvalds rebuked the mainstream modus operandi and allowed Linux to be freely distributed publicly. This
meant that anyone could create their own Operating System, and were not inhibited by licensing barriers.
