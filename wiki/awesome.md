## The Github Awesome List Repositories

One of the more interesting phenomena of Github is the "Awesome" series of repositories found throughout the
site. This was started several years ago by a user who wanted to share "Awesome" open source software with
others. To do so, he simply created a repository and listed the software in the `README.md`. Pretty soon this
user had created several of these "Awesome" repositories, each covering a different topic he wanted to share.
The idea was so popular, it caught on and spread like wildfire throughout the site.
