## Awesome WM: So a guy got bored and wrote his own. 

There has been some experience using Awesome WM in the past, it wasn't necessarily 
a bad experience, and use of it ceased merely out of preference for other options available.
If a user would like a fast setup, there are numerous preconfigured setups out there, which
are practically plug and play.

I highly doubt this topic will be revisted in the future, so if you want more info, it would
be best to checkout the github page for awesome.
