Network OSINT
-------------

Since we have previously defined OSINT as the process of collecting information on a particular
object or entity to facilitate the purpose of reconnaissance. Network OSINT would be the process
of collecting information on a particular network entity or group of network entities. Anyone who
knows about information security lore can tell you network information reconnaissance was inherited from the
days of phone phreaking. When a phreak would search through local phone books take notice of the sequences of
telephone numbers and record which numbers in the sequence were not listed in the local phonebook. The phreak
would then take his compiled list of numbers that were not listed in the phonebook, and would painstakingly
dial every one of them to see which were in service. Those that were in service, but not listed, were referred
to as "unlisted numbers". Thus is where the terminology was born.

There have always been a plethora of software available to perform network OSINT, this is because network
osint actually performs a duty other than collecting information on a particular target. Network
administrators use it all the time to troubleshoot bottlenecks in the network or troubleshoot problematic DNS
resolution. Probably the most famous of these OSINT softwares is NMAP, which anyone who does anything with
networking is familiar with.
