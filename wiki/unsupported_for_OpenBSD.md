## Does not provide support for OpenBSD

Unfortunately, it is growing more and more common for developers to support only the three mainstream operating systems, like Windon't, Mac &
Cheese, and Mainstream Linux. This contradict the spirit of Open Source technology, limits innovation, leads to potential security
vulnerabilities, and creates unnecessary hardships for certain users. Below is a list of projects that do not support OpenBSD.

### The list

This is a list of projects, for whatever reason, are known not to support OpenBSD.

* Terminalizer
* MitMProxy

### Special Cases

This is our naughty list of projects and their developers, who have created a popular project that is often
used as a dependecy for other projects, and have expressed a refusal to support OpenBSD.

#### Puppeteer

The developer was fast to respond, but his response was not clear. Miraculously, he has managed to master the
skills of programming without understanding that sarcasm does not communicate in the written word.

As a linux elitist he refuses to support any BSD project, and only supports (mainstream) Linux and macOS.

##### Depends on puppeteer

Here is the list of projects that use puppeteer as a required dependecy.

* Carbon-now-cli
