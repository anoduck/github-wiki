# Does not provide support for OpenBSD

Unfortunately, it is growing more and more common for developers to support only the three mainstream operating systems, like Windon't, Mac &
Cheese, and Mainstream Linux. This contradict the spirit of Open Source technology, limits innovation, leads to potential security
vulnerabilities, and creates unnecessary hardships for certain users. Below is a list of projects that do not support OpenBSD. 

* Terminalizer
* Puppeteer - Developer contacted, his response was garbled jibberish, and so far he has failed to respond to further inquiry.
* Carbon-now-cli
