## Completion in Emacs

There is a lot more to configuring emacs completion than one might thing, and there are even greater ways to
customize completion than one might desire. The distinction to make is where you want the completion
performed, how you want it performed, how to perform it, and what do you want included in it's performance.

### Where to perform it

Emacs generally provides two most common places to perform completion:

1. In the minibuffer
2. In the main buffer.
