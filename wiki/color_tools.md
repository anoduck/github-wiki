## Color Tools 

It is not often that one needs access to a good color selection and identification tool, but when it happens, nothing can replace it.
Below are a couple of good online color tools and references that might be found particularly benefitial.

* [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)

Besides possessing a wonderful color wheel, the Adobe color wheel application helps users select color palettes that blend well with
each other. 

* [Leonardo](https://leonardocolor.io/)

Leonardo is a color tool for design systems particularly targeted towards user interfaces and data visualization. It is another tool
created by and maintained by Adobe.

* [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co)

Coolors is where the creation of rich color systems begin. It possesses all the basic features to get the creative process going and
provides an environment where creativity runs free.

* [gcolor2](https://gcolor2.sourceforge.net/)

There is no telling how mant times this little program has saved my butt in graphical design. I use it as a dictionary of colors to
lookup color hex identifiers, both forwards and in reverse.
