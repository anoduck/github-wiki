## The Lua Programming language

"Lua" is portugese for the earth's moon, and should always be spelled with a captial "L", followed by lower case "ua".

Mostly used for configuration files and scripting, Lua has exploded in popularity. It is noted as being super
fast, flexible, and possessing a comprehensible syntax.
