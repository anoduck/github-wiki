## The comforts of shell

Here is a nice introduction to shell. It explains what they are, what differentiates them from the command
line, and the different varieties of shell available.

### Bash

Here is where I write a nice introduction about the Bourne again shell.

Here is my page to the wiki page for bash --> [bash](bash)

### ZSH

Here is where I take a stab at explaining what ZSH is, and why zsh differs from bash.

Here is my page on zsh --> [zsh](zsh)

### The Best I have used to date:

Clearly and unequaled, the best shell experience I have encountered is running zsh with the zi framework
installed. Honestly, it is unparelleled.
