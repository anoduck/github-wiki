## The comforts of shell

Here is a nice introduction to shell. It explains what they are, what differentiates them from the command
line, and the different varieties of shell available.

### Bash

Here is where I write a nice introduction about the Bourne again shell.

Here is my page to the wiki page for bash --> [bash](bash)

* [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it)

### ZSH

Here is where I take a stab at explaining what ZSH is, and why zsh differs from bash.

Here is my page on zsh --> [zsh](zsh)

### New Commands

Recently a few new commands have been encountered, that have never been seen before. Unsure if they are new arrivals
or if they are older commands which were unknown of. Either way, they listed below.

#### newgrp

Newgroup allows a user to initiate and finalize changes to group membership without having to log out and in again.
This feature becomes handy when the user does not need to lose any established environment variables.

#### Pushd

Pushd comes from perl, and appears to be part of the standard perl package. The best way to describe the
functionality of pushd is to think of it as a temporary change directory command. As it allows the user to designate a
directory to change into, and when ready, executing the command again without any arguements then will return the
user back to the directory he started out in.
