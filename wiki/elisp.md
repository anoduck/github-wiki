Elisp: May God have mercy on us.
================================

If you are reading this page, then you have some interest in learning Elisp. Elisp is different than common lisp, as
it is specifically written for processing from within the Emacs text editor. Yes, the two most common and popular text
editors in history, Emacs and Vim, both have their own programming languages. Although, from experience, one does
not need to learn one iota of Vim lang to run Vim, familiarity with Elisp is very useful to run Emacs.

The common user does not need to know more Elisp than is required to appropriately setup their own
configuration file, which is not much. By comparison, if a user wanted to write their own Emacs package, then
the amount of knowledge needed would vary. If rather lofty goals are in mind, this could result in a very
daunting achievement.

Once a rather young, inexperienced, but highly motivated user asked posted on Reddit how he had no experience
in programming, but wanted to learn and had chosen Elisp to be the first language he learned. As typical with
Reddit, numerous users were more concerned about words of discouragement that might result in "hurting his feelings", 
than saving the young programmer from what would inevitably be a disheartening and tortuise experience for any
fledgling noob to undergo.
