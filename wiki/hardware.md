Computer Hardware Repair
========================

At some point in your life, a computer will break, and your going to want to fix it. If you are not lazy, you
can actually accomplish more than you think, and once you have gone through the steps a couple of times, it is
just like riding a bicycle.

Before you begin
-----------------

Follow the steps repeated constantly in the BBC sitcom "The I.T. Crowd", and I quote.

    Have you tried turning it on and off again?
    Is the button on the side glowing?
    Does it make any noise?
    Have you tried to see if it is even plugged in?
    Have you checked the monitor to see if that is plugged in?

Next, power it off, disconnect the power cable, and let it sit there for a minimum of five minutes
disconnected. Computers have capacitors that store electricity, it takes time for them to drain out.

Then disconnect all external cables, unplug all usb devices, disconnect all the hardrive cables, and see
if it beeps. This means your mobo is looking for a hardrive and can't find it, because obviously you just
disconnected it. This is a good sign.

Keep in mind, a somepoint in the troubleshooting process you will need to check to see if there is a short in
the actual casing itself. At what point in the process you choose to do this is your choice, but it does need
to be done. You do this by removing the mobo and power supply from the casing, set it on a table, and see if
the system will boot without the case.
