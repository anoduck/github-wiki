## Hyprland Desktop

Hyprland advertises itself as the tiling window manager that isn't short on the eye candy, and it is making
quite a splash in the community. We have had our eye on hyprland for sometime, and were waiting for it to
become available in our distro's repositories before trying it out. Recently, this is exactly what we
discovered, and were pleasantly pleased with what we found. 

Hyprland isn't just the flashiest desktop for wayland, it is also one of the best performing and easiest to
setup.
