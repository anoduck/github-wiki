Internet Relay Chat
--------------------

Internet Relay Chat, or simply IRC, is a standardized network communication protocol that allows members of a
dedicated "channel" to communicate with each other as a group. IRC follows the "server/client" model, meaning
the clients require a connection to a server which hosts the channel and manages all communication that takes
place there in. IRC is also fairly old, being one of the first technologies of it's kind, and dating back to
the early eighties (?, I bullshitted this one.). It's age, popularity, and acessibility has granted IRC a
significantly historical place amongst developers. Nearly every Open Source program and Operating System
maintains it's own dedicated IRC channel to provide support and input to it numerous users.
