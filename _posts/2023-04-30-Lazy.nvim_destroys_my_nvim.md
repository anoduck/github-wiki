## Lazy.nvim Destroys my NVIM init

After noticing [VonHeikemen](https://github.com/VonHeikemen) migrate his ever so popular neovim
starter pack from packer to the lazy package manager, I believed mirroring this change in my own
configuration was worth an effort. This assumption has proven to be quite disastrous to what was a
very comfortable and manageable nvim setup.

As it turns out, Packer was very forgiving and flexible in regards to lua code. Where lazy does not even come
close to providing as flexible structure for parsing lua. The end result is the majority of the nicieties of
my nvim configuration are mostly broken, and there are numerous bugs that must be tamed in order to have a
workable installation again. There is some serious thought about just reverting these changes and moving
forward.

So far, here is the list of items broken:

* [ ] Lazy.vim complains of bad syntax in ghost package.
* [ ] Alpha.nvim is now broken.
* [ ] Treesitter now downloads the the "ensure" grammars on every startup.
* [ ] Markdown parsing is broken.
* [ ] Nvim-QT is no longer applying configuration in `ginit.vim`
* [ ] WhichKey is broken.
* [ ] lazy.nvim does not allow resourcing init.lua after start.

So far, I do not see any reason why anyone would move to lazy.nvim
