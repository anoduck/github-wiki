## Notes on building a Document Authenticity Platform

An attempt to reclaim document originality lost through the digitization of media.

### Motivation

For the comon man, a document's claim to authenticity is rather irrelevant, as long as it contains the same
contents as the original, it matters little. In contrast to this is the world of journalism and legal matters
where authenticity and verification is upmost prioritized. 

This concept was conceived prior to the government passing laws allowing digital notarization, and was
originally created to play a similar role. The entire point was to create a digital signature for a document,
compile the document along with this signature into an encrypted token, then add this token to a blockchain,
finally this token could be used along with the original document to create a NFT of the document that could
then be uploaded to the ipfs.
